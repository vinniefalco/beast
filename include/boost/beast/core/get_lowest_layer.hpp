/** Return the lowest layer in a stack of stream layers.

    If `t.next_layer()` is well-defined, returns
    `lowest_layer(t.next_layer())`. Otherwise, it returns `t`.

    A stream layer is an object of class type which wraps another object through
    composition, and meets some or all of the named requirements of the wrapped
    type while optionally changing behavior. Examples of stream layers include
    `net::ssl::stream` or @ref beast::websocket::stream. The owner of a stream
    layer can interact directly with the wrapper, by passing it to stream
    algorithms. Or, the owner can obtain a reference to the wrapped object by
    calling `next_layer()` and accessing its members. This is necessary when it is
    desired to access functionality in the next layer which is not available
    in the wrapper. For example, @ref websocket::stream permits reading and
    writing, but in order to establish the underlying connection, members
    of the wrapped stream (such as `connect`) must be invoked directly.

    Usually the last object in the chain of composition is the concrete socket
    object (for example, a `net::basic_socket` or a class derived from it).
    The function @ref get_lowest_layer exists to easily obtain the concrete
    socket when it is desired to perform an action that is not prescribed by
    a named requirement, such as changing a socket option, cancelling all
    pending asynchronous I/O, or closing the socket (perhaps by using
    @ref close_socket).

    @par Example
    @code
    // Set non-blocking mode on a stack of stream
    // layers with a regular socket at the lowest layer.
    template <class Stream>
    void set_non_blocking (Stream& stream)
    {
        error_code ec;
        // A compile error here means your lowest layer is not the right type!
        get_lowest_layer(stream).non_blocking(true, ec);
        if(ec)
            throw system_error{ec};
    }
    @endcode

    @param t The layer in a stack of layered objects for which the lowest layer is returned.
